This website is a digital version of my traditional paper resume. It shows my education, skills,  previous positions and projects I've worked on. But, it also shows things I cannot accurately share using a paper resume(such as links to my projects)

This projects also was designed to auto-update its content using the Github API & some configuration JSON files the end goal is to make a personal webpage that doesn't need any manual updating & redeployment.
